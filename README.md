### How to Use
Once you got the package there are 2 ways you can take screenshots. 


- First way is to click on Screenshot Utils MenuItem ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73052518/168259448-2a325039-a872-420b-83ae-944d3f8e6720.png)
 
 **(Pro Tip)** You can also use *Alt + Insert* to take the screenshot 
- Second is through code by calling `Screenshot.CaptureScreenshot()`  

**(Pro Tip)** You can also specify a path to save the file in the parameters. For Eg
![ScreenshotUtils](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73052518/168260742-7bc194df-bbff-4849-b4c7-ccd55f38fa58.png)

Here whenever player collides with an object, I am saving a screenshot in a custom folder defined by me.
